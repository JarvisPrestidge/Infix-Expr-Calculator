# Infix-Expr-Calculator

Program that takes input from the user in the form of an infix expression, converts it to a postfix expression before calculating the result and returning it back to the user. This was a fun little kata to practice test driven development and try out this new project structure that I've settled on for C++ projects!

Make is the designated build tool for this project, it handles building the binary and any tests files living in "/test".

To run the program simply type "make" in the root dir, with GNU make installed and execute the binary found in "/bin".
